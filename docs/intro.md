# Google Earth Engine Introduction

## Why Google Earth? 

Research in Remote Sensing has evolved drastically over the past few decades. Initially, only a handful of governments had the capability to deploy satellites and reliably process satellite imagery, and its use was largely limited to the military and intelligence communities. Organizations such as National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the European Space Agency (ESA) were established to bridge the technology gap and incorporate civilian academic research, but there remained significant hurdles in the process and research was constrained by scheduling funding and political interests. Even if a researcher had identified available data, they would have to obtain it, store it, obtain time to use a computing system that could handle the task, perform geo-rectification and then process the results. This was a time-consuming, costly and often prohibitively inefficient way of using satellite imagery for research. 

Enter Google Earth Engine (GEE). As part of Google's quest to make the world's information universally accessible and useful, the Earth Engine is their answer to organizing and simplifying satellite imagery and geospatial data in a way that supports an end-to-end solution for research. This is a valuable tool that solves many of the historical problems that Remote Sensing researchers have struggled with. It has collected petabytes of imagery from both public and private sources, including the most-used Landsat, MODIS and Sentinel data. Additionally, it allows users to process the data and conduct sophisticated analysis on their data of choice within Google's Cloud environment (even allowing advanced Machine Learning using TensorFlow Processing Units). They also geo-rectify the image and provide pre-built algorithms that simplify the analysis process. In case you need to build your own algorithms, Google Earth Engine has built functionality within JavaScript and Python, allowing a virtually unlimited toolbox for working with the data. The user can even import their own data and work with it within GEE. Finally, the user owns the analysis and algorithms written within GEE, providing fair and open use.   

As researchers intending to use Remote Sensing, learning Google Earth Engine will provide an invaluable toolset throughout your career.
