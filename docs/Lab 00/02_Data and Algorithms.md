## Core Components of Google Earth Engine 

Google Earth Engine starts with an introduction of data structures and the operations you can use to analyze your data structures. To work effectively with GEE, it is essential that you understand these core components and how to complete basic operations with each of them. 

[Intro to Data](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides)

- [`Image`](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/image_overview)
  - Raster Image, a fundamental data type within Earth Engine
- [`ImageCollection`](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/ic_creating)
  - Stack, or time-series of images with the same attributes
- [`Geometry`](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/geometries)
  - Vector data, either built within Earth Engine or imported
- [`Feature`](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/features)
  -  `Geometry` with specific attributes.
- [`FeatureCollection`](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/feature_collections)
  - Set of features that share a similar theme
- [`Reducer`](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/reducers_intro)
  - Object used to compute statistics or perform aggregations on the data
- [`Join`](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/joins_intro)
  - Combine datasets (`Image` or `Feature` collections) based on time, location, or an attribute
- [`Array`](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/arrays_intro)
  - Multi-dimensional analyses.
